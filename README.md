bulls and cows is an old code breaking game. Create a porgram that will play a game with the user. The working of the game is as follows:
1. Randomly generate a 4 digit number
2. Ask the user to guess the 4 digit number
3. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a cow
4. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the wrong place, they have a bull
5. Every time the user makes a guess, tell him how many cows and bulls he has
6. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over
7. Keep track of the number of guesses that the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.

Ex: say the number generated randomly is 1038. For the first guess, the user enters 1234. He has 2 cows and 0 bulls
Now, the second guess is 1256. He now has 1 cow and 0 bulls.
